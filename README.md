# tiger-compiler
Finally learning a bit more about code generation.

This repo is going to cover a chunk of the material from "The Tiger Book", i.e. "Modern Compiler Implementation in ML", but I'll be just writing it in Haskell because it's easier for me. I'm skipping the sections on parsing, instead I'll just write a typical parser-combinator style parser, probably with megaparsec, instead. 

Really, what I want to get out of this is just more experience with proper compilation because mostly I just write interpreters.
